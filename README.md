# LUDUM DARE 49: Unstable

This is my third attempt to deliver something at Ludum Dare Jam.

In this game, the player will control an astronaut that must take care of an unstable planet with a high vulcano activity. Planet stability must be assured by "feeding" the land with elements found across the planet or at another neighbour planets.
